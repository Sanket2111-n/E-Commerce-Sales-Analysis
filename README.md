# E-commerce Sales Analysis | Python & Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow using **Python for data preparation and exploratory analysis**, followed by **Power BI for interactive dashboarding**.

The objective is to analyze e-commerce sales data to understand overall performance, sales trends, category contribution, and top-selling products.  
This project is designed at a **fresher data analyst level** with clear logic and basic Python coding.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)
Performed using **Pandas**:
- Checked dataset structure and data types
- Handled missing values and duplicate records
- Standardized column names
- Converted date columns to proper datetime format

---

## ⚙ Feature Engineering
- Extracted **Year** and **Month** from order date
- Calculated **Profit Margin**
- Filtered invalid records (e.g., zero sales)

---

## 📊 Key KPIs Calculated
- Total Sales
- Total Profit
- Average Profit Margin

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:
- Sales by category
- Monthly sales trend
- Profit distribution
- Top 10 products by sales

---

## 📤 Power BI Integration
The final cleaned and feature-engineered dataset was exported from Python and used in **Power BI** to build an interactive dashboard.

### Power BI Dashboard Includes:
- KPI cards (Total Sales, Total Profit, Avg Profit Margin)
- Monthly sales trend (line chart)
- Sales by category (bar chart)
- Top 10 products by sales
- Sales by region (donut chart)
- Slicers for Year, Category, and Region

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Sales are concentrated in a few major categories.
- A small number of products contribute a significant share of revenue.
- Monthly sales show noticeable trends over time.
- Profit margins vary across categories and regions.

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcome
This project showcases:
- Basic Python data analysis skills
- Clean and logical EDA workflow
- Practical use of Python + Power BI together
- Ability to explain business insights clearly as a fresher data analyst
